## Installation

We need to set up our local environment to programming using python , here :

- Install and navigate through the Anaconda [Anaconda Installer](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) .

- Setup and manage the environments.

  ```conda create -n env_name```

   To access this environment through the command line : ```conda activate env_name```

   To check for the Python packages : ```conda list```

- Download Python packages in Anaconda Terminal (we can use pip or conda interchangeably).

  ```pip install pandas```

   ```pip install numpy```

   ```pip install matplotlib```

   ```pip install seaborn```

  ```pip install xgboost```

  ```pip install scikit-learn```

  **OR**

  Install multiple packages at the same time. For example, the command below will install all three packages simultaneously.

  ```conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn```

- Install Jupyter Notebooks.

  ```conda install jupyter notebook```
